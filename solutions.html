            To combat global warming, people can make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2002/aug/22/worldsummit2002.earth21" target="_blank" >individual decisions</a> to be more environmentally conscious.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            However, longlasting change will only occur if permenant, far-reaching decisions are made.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
          Environmental engineers play an important role in this process, imagining and devising ways of protecting the enviornment.

        <p>Addressing global warming requires a multi-faceted approach, involving both individual and collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Some key solutions include:</p>
        <p><b>1. Transition to renewable energy:</b> Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p><b>2. Increase energy efficiency:</b> Improving energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, and transportation can also reduce energy use and emissions.</p>
        <p><b>3. Reduce emissions from transportation:</b> Encouraging the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking, as well as increasing the use of electric and hybrid vehicles, can help reduce emissions from transportation.</p>
        <p><b>4. Increase use of carbon capture and storage:</b> Technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industrial processes can help reduce emissions.</p>
        <p><b>5. Promote reforestation and forest conservation:</b> Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so reforestation and forest conservation can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p><b>6. Develop climate-resilient infrastructure:</b> Building infrastructure that is designed to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and more frequent and intense weather events, can help reduce the costs and impacts of climate change.</p>
        <p><b>7. Encourage individual action:</b> Individuals can also take action to reduce their carbon footprint, such as by reducing energy use at home, using public transportation or carpooling, and eating a plant-based diet.</p>
