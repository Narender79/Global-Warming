          1. Global warming is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), into the Earth's atmosphere. These activities include burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy, deforestation, and agriculture.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left" id="causes_text" >
          2. When these activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, they trap heat from the sun and prevent it from radiating back into space, causing the Earth's temperature to increase. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution, leading to a steady rise in global temperatures over the past century.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left" id="causes_text" >
          3. Other human activities, such as industrial processes and transportation, also contribute to global warming by releasing other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, into the atmosphere. Natural factors, such as volcanic activity and changes in solar radiation, can also contribute to climate change, but their impact is much smaller than that of human activities.
